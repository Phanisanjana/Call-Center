# Call-Center Insights Dashboard

## Overview
Explore the latest trends in call center operations, visualizing customer and agent behavior. In this project, I conducted a thorough analysis of call center data using Power BI, unearthing valuable insights into customer behavior and satisfaction levels. The dashboard I created presents key performance indicators, including call volume, call duration, agent performance, and customer satisfaction rankings, providing a comprehensive view of the call center's operations.

## Key Findings
One of the most compelling discoveries from our analysis is the strong connection between extended hold times and negative customer assessments. Customers who experienced longer wait times on hold were significantly more likely to rate their overall experience negatively.

## Dashboard Features
- Overall customer satisfaction
- Overall calls answered/abandoned
- Calls by time
- The average speed of answer
- Agentâ€™s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs. calls answered

## Recommendations
Armed with these insights, I formulated actionable recommendations to enhance the overall customer experience:
- Increase the number of call center employees during peak hours to reduce wait times.
- Implement optimized call routing strategies to minimize hold times.
- Continuously monitor and analyze customer satisfaction rankings to identify areas for improvement.

## Future Endeavors
I take pride in my contributions to this project and eagerly anticipate further opportunities to leverage Power BI for uncovering insights and guiding strategic business decisions. Special thanks to PwC and Forage for providing this invaluable virtual internship experience.
